        >The capybara or greater capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is the
        largest living rodent native to South America. It is a member of the
        genus Hydrochoerus. The only other extant member is the lesser capybara
        (Hydrochoerus isthmius). Its close re/laties include guinea pigs and
        rock cavies, and it is more distantly related to the agouti, the
        chinchilla, ad the nutria. The capybara inhabits savannas and dense
        forests, and lives near bodies of water.</span
